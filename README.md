WebSocketBook
=============

Source code files that accompany the book "The Definitive Guide to HTML5 WebSocket" (Apress, 2013) available at http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-HTML5-WebSocket-Apress/dp/1430247401).

Use the files in this repository to build the following:
* ch2-websocket-api: a simple WebSocket client that establishes a WebSocket connection with a WebSocket echo server (websocket.org)
* ch3-websocket-protocol: a WebSocket client that uses the WebSocket protocol, API, and a WebSocket echo server
* ch4-xmpp-over-ws: a chat client that communicates over the Web using XMPP over WebSocket
* ch5-stomp-over-ws: rock-paper-scissors game with Apache ActiveMQ using STOMP over WebSocket
* ch6-vnc-over-ws: a VNC client using RFB over WebSocket and a VNC server

The book also comes with a VirtualBox VM (about 2GB), available at http://kaazingcorp.cachefly.net/com/WebSocketBookVM/WebSocketBook.ova. If you want to get a feel for what's in the VM, you can watch screencasts of the VM at http://www.websocket.org/book.html.
